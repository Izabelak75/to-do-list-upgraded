##  Feature Improvement

This upgrade introduces two new buttons that improve task management:

1. **Hide / Show Completed Tasks** – toggles the visibility of finished tasks. 
2. **Mark All as Completed** – marks every task as completed.

Additional behavior:
- The buttons are hidden when the task list is empty. 
- If all tasks are already completed, the “Mark All as Completed” button is disabled.
